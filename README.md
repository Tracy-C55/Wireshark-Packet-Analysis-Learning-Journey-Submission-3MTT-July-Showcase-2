******Project Titl****e**: Decoding Cyber Threats with Wireshark: A Beginner‚Äôs Deep Dive  
****Name****: Tracy Nworie  
**Fellow ID**: FE/24/686089367  
****Cohort****: 3 (Cybersecurity Track)  
***Tool Used**: Wireshark
## üß† Project Overview
This project is part of the **3MTT Knowledge Showcase (July 2025 Edition)**, submitted under the **Learning Journey** category.  
It demonstrates the use of **Wireshark**, a packet capturing and analysis tool, to examine potentially malicious network activity and simulate basic threat detection.
##  Project Structure

##  Analysis Summary
- **Scenario**: A suspected malicious file was downloaded from a fake software site.
 - **Traffic Observed**:
 - DNS resolution to suspicious domain
 - HTTP GET request for an executable file
- Repeated outbound connections to foreign IP addresses
- **Detection**:
 - Used Wireshark filters:
- `http.request`
 - `dns.qry.name contains ".exe"`
 - `ip.addr == suspicious_IP`
- **Outcome**: Confirmed signs of **malicious file download** and **data exfiltration attempt**.
